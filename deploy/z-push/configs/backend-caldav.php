// The default is to always include the calendar collection, unless either include or exclude is uncommented and configured.
// The calendar collection is included, either when the include filter is not configured, or when the include filter matches.
// The calendar collection is excluded, when the exclude filter is configured and it matches. Exclude always wins over include.
// The defined constants can either be a string or an array of multiple strings, to provide multiple filters.
// Exclude example: '*/archived-appointments/'
// Include example: '*sync*'
